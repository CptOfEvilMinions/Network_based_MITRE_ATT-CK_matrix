This can be done by sending emails with false domain names which appear legitimate, or by setting up websites with slightly altered characters that read as correct. Commonly, a spoof website or email will use logos, or any other kind of accurate visual design to effectively imitate the styling and branding of a legitimate enterprise or business. Users will commonly be prompted to enter financial details or other sensitive data, trusting that they are being sent to the right place.

## Preventions

* Use trusted DNS servers like OpenDNS or Google's public DNS service.

## Detections

* Monitor DNS queries in the environment. If the base domain of the query does not exist in Alexa's top million attempt to:
  * Do a `WHOIS` lookup on the domain to see when the domain was registered. If the domain is less than 30 days old then there is a grater likelihood it is malicious..
  * Apply an algorithm to detect how similar the base domain in the query is to your organization's domain or a domain in Alexa's top million. Attackers will register domains that look similar to your domain but may have two letters swapped.
* If your environment has a baseline of the domains visited you can detect new domains.
