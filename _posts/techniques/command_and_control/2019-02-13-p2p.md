Botnet masters stand to lose access to thousands or millions of infected computers if their control servers are shut down, so theyâ€™re looking into decentralized P2P communications, where botnet clients can relay commands to one another, as a resilience technique along with other methods like the use of domain name generation algorithms (DGAs), he said.

Another benefit for attackers is that malicious P2P traffic is hard to detect and block at the network level by using traditional approaches that rely on lists of known IP addresses and hosts associated with C&C servers.
