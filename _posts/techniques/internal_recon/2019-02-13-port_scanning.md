## Types of scans

![TCP handshake](/assets/images/tcp-handshake.png)

* ACK Scan - sends TCP packets with only the ACK flag set. This scan may get two outcomes as a result:
  * RST packet (the port is closed or open).

* SYN Scan(Stealth scan) - sends TCP packets with only the SYN flag set. This scan may get two outcomes as a result:
  * TCP packet with SYN + ACK flags set (the port is open)
  * RST packet (the port is closed. This scan starts a normal TCP session - but it does not finish the TCP session establishment with an ACK: it is only half finished.

* TCP Connect Scan - scan is a the odd scan in this collection of scans. A TCP Scan use the connect () system call against its victim. TCP Connect Scan do not use TCP flags. This kind of scan is often recognized and logged by servers.

* NULL Scan - sends TCP packets with no flag set. This scan may get two outcomes as a result:
  * no response (the port is open)
  * RST packet (the port is closed).

* FIN Scan - sends TCP packets with only the FIN flag set. This scan may get two outcomes as a result:
  * no response (the port is open)
  * RST (the port is closed).

* XMAS Scan - sends TCP packets with FIN, PSH and URG flags set (lighting the packet up like a Christmas three). This scan may get two outcomes as a result:
  * no response (the port is open)
  * RST (the port is closed).

## Detections

NMAP is a popular port scanning tool that has several methods of scanning ports. BRO has the ability to detect some of these methods by analyzing the `conn_state` in `conn.log`:

| Type of NMAP scan | BRO conn state | NMAP command | Description |
| :--: | :--: | :--: | :--: |
| ACK scan | `RSTRH` | `nmap <IP> -p [22,23] -sA` | ACK scan port open and closed |
| Stealth scan | `RSTOS0` | `nmap <IP> -p 22 -sS` | Stealth scan port open |
| Stealth scan | `REJ` | `nmap <IP> -p 23 -sS` | Stealth scan port closed |
| FIN Scan | `SH` x2 | `nmap <IP> -p 22 -sF` | FIN scan port open |
| FIN Scan | `RSTR` | `nmap <IP> -p 23 -sF` | FIN scan port closed |
| XMAS Scan | `SH` x2 | `nmap <IP> -p 22 -sX` | XMAS scan port open |
| XMAS Scan | `RSTR` | `nmap <IP> -p 23 -sX` | XMAS scan port closed |
| TCP Connect Scan | `RSTOS0` | `nmap <IP> -p 22 -sT` | TCP Connect Scan port open |
| TCP Connect Scan | `REJ` | `nmap <IP> -p 23 -sT` | TCP Connect Scan port closed |
