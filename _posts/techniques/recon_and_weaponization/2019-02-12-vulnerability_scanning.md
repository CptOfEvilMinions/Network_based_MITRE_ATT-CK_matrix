## Malware/Threat actors

<!-- Threat actors table -->
{% assign malwares = 'GRIZZLY STEPPE,XSLCmd,Pitty Tiger,Rocket Kitten,Copy Kittens,CARBANAK,Volatile Cedar' | split: ',' %}
{% assign threat_actors = site.data.threat_actors %}

{% include threat_table.html %}

## Preventions

* Putting a network intrusion prevention system(NIPS) inline. These devices will analyze network traffic for known malicious traffic and block when malicious activity is detected.

## Detections

* Enterprise level vulnerability scanners will include unique identifiers in the traffic to specify it's a vulnerability scanner, unless specified not too. For example, Nessus will set the SSH client identifier to `SSH-2.0-TenableRocks` when scanning hosts with SSH or Nessus may include `Nessus*` in the user-agent header in HTTP.
