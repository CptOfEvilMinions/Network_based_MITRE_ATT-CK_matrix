## Malware/Threat actors

<!-- Threat actors table -->
{% assign malwares = 'Operation Cleaver,Epic Turla,Energetic Bear,APT37,GRIZZLY STEPPE,Operation Potato,PlugX' | split: ',' %}
{% assign threat_actors = site.data.threat_actors %}

{% include threat_table.html %}


## Preventions

* Utilize up to date web browsers on the network for increased security enhancements. These improvements may include a sandboxing feature that would allow the browser to contain any malicious content and protect the endpoint if an emailed link is clicked.


## Detections

* Look for domain typo-squat domains(Real domain: google.com, Typo-squat: googlw.com).
* Detect messages being received by unknown/unverified SMTP servers. 
* E-mail being sent on port SMTP port 25 with no encryption.
* Monitor HTTP GET requests for resources like `/SDKJbsdfs`
* [Bro Phishing Detection Module](https://github.com/hosom/bro-phishing) - A simple phishing detection for mass phishing campaigns like Dridex. Detects the same email attachment being sent to many recipients.
* [Bro Phishing Detection Module](https://github.com/hosom/bro-phishing) - Detection of emails from domains close to domains within Site::local_zones.
