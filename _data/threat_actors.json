Over the course of nearly a year prior to the attack, these unknown actors clandestinely established persistent access to multiple industrial networks, identified targets, and ultimately carried out a complex set of actions, which not only disrupted electricity distribution in Ukraine, but also destroyed IT systems, flooded call centers, sowed confusion, and inhibited incident response. The attackers used a malware tool, BlackEnergy 3, designed to enable unauthorized network access, then used valid user credentials to move laterally across internal systems, and ultimately shut down electricity distribution using the utilities’ native control systems.",

Its modular structure allows extending it with new features easily, which makes it not only highly sophisticated but also highly flexible and dangerous.

Technical details show how attackers learned from other extremely advanced actors in order to avoid repeating their mistakes. As such, all artifacts are customized per given target, reducing their value as indicators of compromise for any other victim. Usually APT campaigns have a geographical nexus, aimed at extracting information within a specific region or from a given industry. That usually results in several infections in countries within that region, or in the targeted industry around the world. Interestingly, ProjectSauron seems to be dedicated to just a few countries, focused on collecting high value intelligence by compromising almost all key entities it could possibly reach within the target area.",
